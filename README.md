# Amazon Vine Analysis
## Purpose
Jennifer needs our help with a new project. Our goal is to analyze Amazon reviews that were written by paid members of the Amazon Vine program. First, we pick a specific type of product to do our review on. The type of product I chose was video games. We will utilize PySpark to extract the data set, transform the data, connect with a AWS RDS instance, then load the newly transformed data into pgAdmin by performing the ETL process. Next, I used Pandas to analyze the data in order to see if there is any bias regarding complimentary reviews from paid members of the Amazon Vine program in the dataset.
